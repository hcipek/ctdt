# ctdt

This is a passion project of Creating a Database for Android/IOS mobile game Captain Tsubasa Dream Team(will be called CTDT from on).

This is still unfinished project, but my goals are simple.
Step 1 : Designing Models
1. Creating models of a regular player of CTDT.
2. Create post and get requests to inserting new or use data from anywhere.
3. Input will be String values of player data. Create converters to use that String and convert it to related Model of my Project.

Step 2 : Creating Data
1. Using well know CTDT sites to get values for converting.
2. Im planning get that values dynamically(for now at last).
3. In a new project(or this one not sure yet) I will parse that data from html, and posting to this project to create data.

This 2 steps are my main goals. 

After that Im planning to make an team builder project that uses data from that project. 
In that project, user will be send List of players and get best possible teams by Power, Bond Skills, Hidden Abilities etc.

After Team Builder Completed, Im going to make an Frontend Project. 
In that project, Im planning to visualize the results of TeamBuilderProject. That will be a mobile platform based project.

First 2 steps will be easier ones.
3rd one requires good algorithm to build best team possible by given filters and requirements.
Last step is more like
